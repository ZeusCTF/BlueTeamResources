Hostname is leaked here, adding this to /etc/hosts.
Looking at the site, nothing too useful is listed here.  We have a list of potential users, and a "components" page.  
Running a dir scan with gobuster doesn't locate anything new, just an assets directory and the aforementioned components page.

A vhost scan in gobuster does locate a 'beta' subdomain, added this to the hosts file and navigated there to find a "url tester"
I think it's due to my use of the provided attack box (however I am not certain), but I cannot get this to render valid URLs.
Regardless, I tested a variety of URLs (known sites, creative.htb, file:///, etc) and found that you can connect on 127.0.0.1, however I had to do so through burp as the page would never finish loading.
Using this information, we can starting connecting on various ports on localhost to see if there is an internal service (again, I had to use burp's intruder tool instead of a script due to the limitations) to brute force the ports.
Eventually you find 1337, which shows a directory listing of the server
