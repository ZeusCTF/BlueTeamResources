Starting at the web server, the main page seems to offer some kind of functionality related to extracting metadata from uploaded files.
In addition to this, from the source code we can determine that the site utilizes files with the .html extension, instead of something like flask/php.

smbclient -L //server -N

Can't login here without creds/using the anonymous login, so we'll probably need to come back later
