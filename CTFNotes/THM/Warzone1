1.) What was the alert signature for Malware Command and Control Activity Detected?:
A) This can be determined by first finding the appropriate category, then just copying the signature.

2.) What is the source IP address? Enter your answer in a defanged format.
A) This is relatively easy again, using the same event, just copy the src_ip into cyberchef to "defang" it.  Which is essentially the process of making it unusable in case someone were to accidentally click it.

3.) What IP address was the destination IP in the alert? Enter your answer in a defanged format.
A) Basically the same question as 3, just using the dest_ip

4.) Inspect the IP address in VirsusTotal. Under Relations > Passive DNS Replication, which domain has the most detections? Enter your answer in a defanged format. 
A) Pretty much tells you what to do, navigate to the VT site > search tab > search dest IP > look under the passive replication section

5.) Still in VirusTotal, under Community, what threat group is attributed to this IP address?
This section is a bit odd, but the group is listed as TA505
