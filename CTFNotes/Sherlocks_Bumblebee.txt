I installed sqlitebrowser and opened phpbb.sqlite3, looking through the users (specifically the phpbb_users) table, we can look at the user_ip section, and use the username associated with a public IP.

The IP here also answers the second question

For the third question, the answer can be found in the phpbb_posts, just find the poster_ip from the last question and then look at the post_ip colummn

For the fourth question, in the posts table, there is a post that contains an update.php link, that is not referenced in the access.log.  This is the answer
