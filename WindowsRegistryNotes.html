Basic information:

The structure on any given Windows system contains the following root keys:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HKEY_USERS
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

Keys can be viewed by various means, the internal `regedit.exe` program native to Windows will display basic information.
Other Open and Closed-source utilities exist as well, such as RegRipper or Yaru (and many others)

Based on Microsoft documentation (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users), the above mentioned root keys are defined as follows:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER 	Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on. The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here. This information is associated with the user's profile. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCU.

HKEY_USERS 	Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subkey of HKEY_USERS. HKEY_USERS is sometimes abbreviated as HKU.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 	Contains configuration information particular to the computer (for any user). This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKLM.

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT 	Is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software. 
The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer. 
This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCR. 
Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. 
The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. 
The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes key contains settings that override the default settings and apply only to the interactive user. 
The HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key provides a view of the registry that merges the information from these two sources. 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT also provides this merged view for programs that are designed for earlier versions of Windows. 
To change the settings for the interactive user, changes must be made under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes instead of under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. 
To change the default settings, changes must be made under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes. 
If you write keys to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, the system stores the information under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes. 
If you write values to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and the key already exists under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes, the system will store the information there instead of under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes.

HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG 	Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.

The majority of the hives can be found at these locations on the disk as well:
C:\Windows\System32\Config
C:\Users\*user*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows

To note, in addition to these hives, there are user-specific hives that reside in a user's directory (typically C:\Users\*user*).
These files are NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT

(Also, this hive file could be important to check, as it contains info regarding recently run programs: :\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve)

Another note, each location representing a registry hive will also have a .log (possibly more than one) file to denote transactions that will occur in the future, but that haven't been commited to the hive yet.
Similarly, a backup of the registry hives can be found at the below directory:
C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack
