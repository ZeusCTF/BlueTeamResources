When investigating a potentially compromised host, you will want to ensure that only known-good binaries are used.
This can be achieved by mounting an external drive that contains all of the necessary binaries to the suspicious machine.
Upon mounting the drive, add the mount point to the PATH variable so those binaries are used instead.

Common directories for abuse include: /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm due to their unqiue properties of typically being writable by any user
Somewhat related, but this command will look for all files owned by a particular group: find / -group GROUPNAME 2>/dev/null

All files have Metadata, which is essentially embedded information that describes the file itself.
This includes information such as the create date, attributes, file type, author, etc.
Timestamps are a unique attribute as they are potentially the most useful for any type of analysis.
File create, modification, and access times often aid investigators in establishing a timeline of events.

On a Unix system, there are three main timestamps that get recorded:
1) Modify timestamp (mtime) - this reflects the last time the contents of a file were modified or altered.
"ls -l"


2) Change timestamp (ctime) - this timestamp indicates the last time a file's metadata was changed.
This includes things like permissions, ownership, filename, etc.
"ls -lc"


3) Access timestamp (atime) - this indicates the last time a file was accessed or read.
"ls -lu"

(or you can use "stat" to see all attributes at once)

On Unix systems, /etc/ is a special directory that stores configuration files and system-wide settings.
Included in this, is the /etc/passwd/ file, which contains a list of the system's accounts and their attributes.
One common persistance technique is to create a "secret" root user that the attack can later use.
