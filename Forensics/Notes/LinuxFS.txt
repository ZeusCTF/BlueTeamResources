When investigating a potentially compromised host, you will want to ensure that only known-good binaries are used.
This can be achieved by mounting an external drive that contains all of the necessary binaries to the suspicious machine.
Upon mounting the drive, add the mount point to the PATH variable so those binaries are used instead.

Common directories for abuse include: /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm due to their unqiue properties of typically being writable by any user
Somewhat related, but this command will look for all files owned by a particular group: find / -group GROUPNAME 2>/dev/null
