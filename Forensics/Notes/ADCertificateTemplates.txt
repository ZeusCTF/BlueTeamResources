Windows AD is not just intended for IAM procedures, but also provides a significant number of services to help you run and manage an organization.  
Many of these additional services are overlooked by administrators when hardening is performed, with the focus of these notes being on Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).

Common applications of certificates include upgrading web traffic to HTTPS, but what about traffic that is internal on an organization's network?
In this example, do you have to give applications running internally access to the internet to allow them to request a certificate from a trusted CA - the answer is no, thanks to AD CS.

AD CS is Microsoft's PKI implementation.  Since AD provides a level of trust in an organization, it can be used as a CA to prove and delegate trust.  
AD CS is used for several things such as encrypting files systems, creatnug and verifying digital signatures, and even user auth.
Particularly interesting is that certificates can survive credential rotation, meaning even if a compromised account's password is reset, that does nothing to invalidate a maliciously generated certificate.
