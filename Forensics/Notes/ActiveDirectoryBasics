In general terms, a Windows domain is a collection of users and computers under the administration of a given entity.  The idea is to centralize common administrative tasks under an "Active Directory".
A server that runs Active Directory services is known as a Domain Controller.  These services offered come with many benefits, namely:
Centralised identity management, and an easier method of setting security policies across an organization.

User objects in a domain are considered "security principles", meaning they can be assigned access rights over resources on the network (such as files/printers).
Traditionally, users are accounts that an individual employee may access, though user accounts also include service accounts such as those necessary for database services.

Machines are another type of object within Active Directory, with a machine object being created whenever a new computer joins the domain.
Similar to user accounts, machines are considered "security principals" and are assigned an account just as any regular user.
To note, this account is limited on the overall domain, but isi often the local administrator for the assigned computer.

Security Groups are also considered security principals, and can be assigned privileges that are inherited by its members.
For example, say a group is given read access to a folder, if Bob is made a member of that group, he will inherit the read permission given to the group.
Worth noting, groups can have both users and machines as members, as well as other groups.
(AD also allows you to delegate control of an OU to a specific group/user)

Several groups are created by default in a domain, and can automatically granted to users.
Some of these include:
Domain Admins
Server Operators
Backup Operators
Domain Users

Organizational Units are container objects that allow you to classify users and machines.  These are mainly used to define sets of users.

By default, Windows creates a few default containers:
Builtin
Computers
Domain Controllers
Users
Managed Service Accounts

The primary difference between OUs and Security Groups is that OUs are typically used for appplying policies to users and computers, with security groups being used more to grant permissions to resources.
(When managing OUs, Windows has a built-in method of preventing OUs from being deleted, which can be turned off by navigating to the objects properties > Object > unchecking the "protect object from accidental deletion" category.)

By default, all machines that join a domain (except for domain controllers) will be put in a container called "Computers".
(Typically you will create OUs to further seperate these computers, such as a Servers group, Workstation group, and so forth.

In order to actually apply different settings to an OU, Windows uses Group Policy Objects.  These are essentially policies aimed at either users or computers that can set a specific baseline for those accounts.
To configure GPOs, you will typically use the "Group Policy Management" tool that is installed by default.

The first step in creating a new GPO, is to create one under the "Group Policy Objects section, then you can link it to where the policies should be applied
An important note is that an OU will by default be applied to the linked OU, and any sub-OUs under it.

When examining a policy, the "Scope" tab shows where the GPO is linked in the AD domain.
For more granular control, there is a similar setting here called "Security Filtering" that can allow OUs to only be applied to specific users/groups.

The settings tab has the actual contents of the GPO, and lets us know what specific configurations it applies.

GPOs are distributed across the network via a network share called "SYSVOL", which is stored on the DC.
Users within the domain should have access to this share so they can sync their GPOs periodically.

Any changes to GPOs can take awhile to sync, but you can force the sync with a "gpupdate /force"

When using Windows domains, all credentials are stored in the Domain Controllers.
In order to authenticate to a service using domain credentials, two protocols are typically used.
1) Kerberos - Used by recent versions of Windows, typically the default protocol.
2) NetNTLM - Legacy protocol used mainly for compatibility.

Kerberos will assign authenticated users "tickets", which the users can then present to services to demonstarate they are authenticated.

When Kerberos is used for authentication, the following happens:
