In general terms, a Windows domain is a collection of users and computers under the administration of a given entity.  The idea is to centralize common administrative tasks under an "Active Directory".
A server that runs Active Directory services is known as a Domain Controller.  These services offered come with many benefits, namely:
Centralised identity management, and an easier method of setting security policies across an organization.

User objects in a domain are considered "security principles", meaning they can be assigned access rights over resources on the network (such as files/printers).
Traditionally, users are accounts that an individual employee may access, though user accounts also include service accounts such as those necessary for database services.

Machines are another type of object within Active Directory, with a machine object being created whenever a new computer joins the domain.
Similar to user accounts, machines are considered "security principals" and are assigned an account just as any regular user.
To note, this account is limited on the overall domain, but isi often the local administrator for the assigned computer.

Security Groups are also considered security principals, and can be assigned privileges that are inherited by its members.
For example, say a group is given read access to a folder, if Bob is made a member of that group, he will inherit the read permission given to the group.
