Each time you select a packet within the Wireshark GUI interface, two panes are populated - the "Packet Details" pane, and a "Packet Bytes" pane.
Hovering your mouse of information in the packet details pane will cause the corresponding section in the packet bytes pane to become highlighted.

For any given packet, there will be a similar number of layers included in the packet details pane.
These are generally:
Frame (layer 1)
Ethernet (layer 2)
Source IP (layer 3)
Protocol (layer 4)
Application (layer 5)
