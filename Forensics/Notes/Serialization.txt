Serialization is the process of transforming an object's state into a human-readable or binary format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed as and when required.
This is necessary in applications where data must be transferred between different parts of a system or across a network.

Deserialization is essentially the opposite, where you take the formatted data and convert it back into an object.

There have been multiple instances of insecure deserialization causing major security issues, such as Log4j or the WebLogic RCE.

Different programming languages implement serialization, howevever while the logic is essentially the same, the functionality typically differs in name.
In PHP, serialization is accomplished with the serialize() function, which converts a PHP object or array into a byte stream representing the object's data and structure.
This resulting stream can include various daata types, such as arrays or objects (etc), making it unique.
