Splunk apps are defined by an Administrator, or user with an admin role.
Three main roles exist in Splunk:
1) Admin - can install apps, injust data, create knowledge objects
2) Power - Can create and share knowledge objects for users of an app and do realtime searches
3) User - Will only see their own knowledge objects and those shared with them

On the data summary tab/section, the Sourcetypes field refers to classifications of data, Sources are the network ports or files (etc) that data is coming from, and Hosts are the machines data is pulled from

Three search modes exist:
1) Fast - Cuts down on field info returned
2) Smart - toggles behavior based on search ran
3) Verbose - returns as much event data and fields possible

When a search is run, "events" are returned.  Within these events, the text we searched for will be highlighted, with the events returned in a reverse chronological order (newest first)
Time is normalized in the index to a consistent format, the timestamp you see in the event is based on what you set in your account (this would be the time reflected on the far left)
